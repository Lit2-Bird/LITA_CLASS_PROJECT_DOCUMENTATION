# LITA_CLASS_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub

## PROJECT TOPIC: DATA ANALYSIS
## PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
In this project, I am tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. 
I am going to be exploring sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.
The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
